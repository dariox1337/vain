How to call Python code from Godot:

1. Import whatever module you need (for instance, your own module) in websocket_server.py
2. In GDScript make calls using "await PythonBridge.eval("<python code>")"
3. The result is sent back as a single string. It's the job of the caller to parse it.

Keep in mind, it's a high-latency link. It's useful for non-critical functions 
like tokenizer, png metadata reader, making requests to AI, etc. But critical 
functionality should be implemented in Godot.
